-- Advanced SQL Aggregations
-------------------------------------

-- Why Do We Need Advanced SQL?

-- Basic SQL can:
--      Filter rows (WHERE)
--      Aggregate data (GROUP BY)
--      Join tables

-- But…

-- Basic SQL cannot analyze trends, rankings, patterns, or row-level comparisons properly.

-- That’s where Advanced SQL (Window Functions) becomes powerful.



-- Problem with GROUP BY (Limitation)
-- Suppose you want:
--      Show each order
--      AND also show total revenue of that restaurant

-- If you use GROUP BY:
SELECT restaurant_id, SUM(total_amount)
FROM Orders
GROUP BY restaurant_id;

SELECT * FROM orders;

-- Problem:
-- It collapses rows
-- You lose individual order details


-- But what if business wants:
-- Show each order and also tell me how much that restaurant has earned so far.

-- Solution: Advanced SQL (Window Function)

SELECT 
    order_id,
    restaurant_id,
    total_amount,
    SUM(total_amount) OVER (
        PARTITION BY restaurant_id
    ) AS restaurant_total_revenue
FROM Orders;


-- Every row still exists
-- But you also get aggregated info


-- -----------------------------------------------------------------


-- Window Function
-- -------------------------
-- What is a Window Function?

-- A window function performs a calculation across a set of rows related to the current row
-- but it does NOT collapse rows like GROUP BY.

-- Key idea: It gives aggregated or analytical results while keeping every row visible.

-- When Should You Use Window Functions?

-- Use when you need:
-- Ranking (Top N)
-- Running totals
-- Moving averages
-- Compare with previous row
-- Contribution percentage
-- Trend analysis



-- Basic Syntax 
-- ---------------

-- function() OVER (
--     PARTITION BY column
--     ORDER BY column
-- )

-- or

-- function() OVER (window_spec)



-- OVER(window_spec)
-- -----------------

-- Each window operation in the query is signified by inclusion of an OVER clause 
-- that specifies how to partition query rows into groups for processing by the window function.

-- This tells SQL:
-- “Don’t collapse rows. Apply this calculation over a window.”

-- Without OVER(), it becomes normal aggregate.

-- Example: Without OVER()
-- One row per restaurant.

SELECT restaurant_id, SUM(total_amount)
FROM Orders
GROUP BY restaurant_id;


-- Example: With OVER()
-- All rows kept + aggregate added.

SELECT 
    order_id,
    restaurant_id,
    total_amount,
    SUM(total_amount) OVER (PARTITION BY restaurant_id) AS restaurant_total
FROM Orders;


-- To use a window function (or to treat an aggregate function as a window function), 
-- you must include an OVER clause immediately after the function call. 

-- The OVER clause defines the window of rows the function should operate on, 
-- such as specifying partitions, ordering, or frame boundaries.


-- Empty OVER(): which treats the entire set of query rows as a single partition. 
-- Example:

SELECT SUM(total_amount) as total_revenue
FROM orders;

SELECT 
    order_id,
    total_amount,
    SUM(total_amount) OVER() AS total_revenue
FROM Orders;


SELECT 
    order_id,
    COUNT(*) OVER() AS total_orders
FROM Orders;


-- Use it when:

-- You need global total
-- You need global average
-- You need percentage contribution
-- You need total row count
-- But still want row-level detail.




-- OVER (window_spec)
-- -------------------

-- window_spec:
--     [partition_clause] 
--     [order_clause]


-- PARTITION BY [partition_clause]
-----------------------------------

-- This divides rows into groups (like GROUP BY)
-- BUT keeps rows separate.

-- Example:
-- SUM(total_amount) OVER (PARTITION BY restaurant_id)

-- Meaning:
-- Calculate sum separately for each restaurant
-- Show it for every row of that restaurant


SELECT 
    order_id,
    restaurant_id,
    total_amount,
    SUM(total_amount) OVER (
        PARTITION BY restaurant_id
    ) AS restaurant_total
FROM Orders;


-- ORDER BY (Inside OVER) [order_clause]
-- -----------------------------------------

-- An ORDER BY clause indicates how to sort rows in each partition.

-- Used for:

-- Ranking
-- Running totals
-- Moving averages

-- Rank orders by amount within each restaurant
SELECT 
    order_id,
    restaurant_id,
    total_amount,
    RANK() OVER (
        PARTITION BY restaurant_id
        ORDER BY total_amount DESC
    ) AS rank_within_restaurant
FROM Orders;

-- Frame
-- ------

-- What Is a Frame?

-- Inside a window function, we define:
--    Partition (group)
--    Order
--    Frame (which rows inside that ordered partition should be used)

-- The frame decides:
--    From which row to which row should the calculation happen?


-- Structure: 
-- ROWS BETWEEN start_point AND end_point

-- Where start and end can be:

-- UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
-- n PRECEDING
-- CURRENT ROW
-- n FOLLOWING
-- UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING


-- Example:

-- Imagine ordered sales:
-- | Row | Sale |
-- | --- | ---- |
-- | 1   | 100  |
-- | 2   | 200  |
-- | 3   | 300  |
-- | 4   | 400  |
-- | 5   | 500  |


-- If current row = 3 (value = 300)
-- Frame examples:

-- | Frame Clause                      | Included Rows |
-- | --------------------------------- | ------------- |
-- | UNBOUNDED PRECEDING → CURRENT ROW | 1,2,3         |
-- | 2 PRECEDING → CURRENT ROW         | 1,2,3         |
-- | CURRENT ROW → 2 FOLLOWING         | 3,4,5         |
-- | 1 PRECEDING → 1 FOLLOWING         | 2,3,4         |




-- Example: ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING

-- UNBOUNDED PRECEDING: Start from the very first row in the partition.
-- UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING: Go until the very last row in the partition.

-- Actual logical execution order:

-- WINDOW FUNCTIONS
-- SELECT
-- DISTINCT
-- ORDER BY
-- LIMIT


-- That’s why window functions:

-- Cannot be used in WHERE
-- Cannot be used in GROUP BY
-- Cannot be used in HAVING

-- Because they are calculated AFTER those steps.
